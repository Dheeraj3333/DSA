## üîç What is Type Casting?

**Type casting** in Java is the process of **converting one data type into another**.  
Java is a statically typed language, so **you must tell it explicitly** when you're converting between **incompatible types**.

---

## üß≠ Two Types of Type Casting

### 1. Widening Casting (Automatic / Implicit)
- Converts **smaller type to larger type**
- **Safe** because no data is lost

| From | To |
|------|----|
| byte | short, int, long, float, double |
| short | int, long, float, double |
| char | int, long, float, double |
| int | long, float, double |
| long | float, double |
| float | double |

```java
int a = 10;
double b = a; // implicit casting: int to double
System.out.println(b); // Output: 10.0
```

### 2. Narrowing Casting (Manual / Explicit)
- Converts **larger type to smaller type**
- **Can lose data** or cause errors

```java
double x = 9.78;
int y = (int) x; // explicit casting: double to int
System.out.println(y); // Output: 9
```

## üí° Real-World Analogy

- **Widening** = pouring water from a cup into a bucket (safe)
- **Narrowing** = pouring water from a bucket into a cup (may overflow)

###### Note : Beginners can skip from here as to understand this you should have a basic knowledge of OOPs

## üì¶ Casting Between Reference Types (Objects)

### 1. Upcasting (Automatic) child class --> parent class
```java
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}

Animal a = new Dog(); // upcasting
```

### 2. Downcasting (Manual) parent class --> child class
```java
Animal a = new Dog();
if (a instanceof Dog) {
    Dog d = (Dog) a;
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Casting without checking | ClassCastException |
| Too much narrowing | Overflow or truncation |
| Incompatible references | Compile-time error |

```java
int large = 130;
byte small = (byte) large;
System.out.println(small); // Output: -126
```

## üìú Summary Cheat Sheet

| Casting Type | Direction | Automatic? | Risky? | Example |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|--------|---------|
| Widening | Small ‚Üí Large | Yes | No | int to double |
| Narrowing | Large ‚Üí Small | No | Yes | double to int |
| Upcasting | Child ‚Üí Parent | Yes | No | Dog to Animal |
| Downcasting | Parent ‚Üí Child | No | Yes | Animal to Dog |

## üß™ Practice Challenge

What will be the output?

```java
float f = 123.456f;
int i = (int) f;
System.out.println(i);
```

‚û°Ô∏è Answer: `123` (fractional part is truncated)
